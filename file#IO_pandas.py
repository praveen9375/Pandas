#First, we'll read from the two CSV files 'stats.csv' and 'salary.csv'. These files contain the stats and salaries, respectively, of various baseball players.
import pandas as pd
stats_df = pd.read_csv('stats.csv')
salary_df = pd.read_csv('salary.csv')
#we can just merge the stats_df and salary_df DataFrames.
import pandas as pd
#stats_df = pd.read_csv('stats.csv')
#salary_df = pd.read_csv('salary.csv')
df=pd.merge(stats_df, salary_df)
#Finally, we write the merged DataFrame into the file named 'out.csv'. Since the original CSV files didn't label the rows, we'll make sure not to label the rows of 'out.csv'.
import pandas as pd
df.to_csv('out.csv', index =False)
